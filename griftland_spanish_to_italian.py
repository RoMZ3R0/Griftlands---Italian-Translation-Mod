Title: Griftland translation script
Author: RoMZERO
Version: 1.0

Description:
This script is designed to translate text from a `.po` file (commonly used for localization) 
from Spanish to Italian. It utilizes the Google GenAI API with a specifically configured 
Generative AI model tailored for translating game-related content, ensuring high semantic 
accuracy and contextual relevance.

The translation process adheres to the following principles:
- Maintains the original meaning and context of the source text.
- Avoids literal translations unless necessary, prioritizing fluency and naturalness in Italian.
- Preserves proper names, symbols, and English text without translation.
- Handles escape sequences (`\n`) and special characters properly.
- Ensures variables (e.g., `{1}`, `player:`, `\\n`) remain unaltered.

Features:
- The script reads lines from an input `.po` file (`es.po`) and translates only 
  the content of lines starting with `msgstr`.
- Translated content is cleaned to remove unnecessary quotes, correct formatting, and maintain proper spacing.
- Handles exceptions gracefully, returning the original text if an error occurs during translation.
- Writes the translated content to a new `.po` file (`it.po`) while preserving the file's structure.

Note:
The script includes a 4-second delay between translations to avoid exceeding the API request limit.
